CHAPTER 1: PHYSICAL WORLD

Physics is the study of matter, energy, and their interactions. It seeks to understand how the universe works at the most fundamental level.

Key Concepts:
- Matter and Energy
- Forces and Motion  
- Waves and Particles
- Space and Time

Physics helps us understand natural phenomena and develop technology that improves our lives.

The scope of physics includes:
1. Mechanics - study of motion
2. Thermodynamics - study of heat
3. Electromagnetism - study of electric and magnetic fields
4. Quantum mechanics - study of atomic and subatomic particles
5. Relativity - study of space and time

Physics uses mathematical models to describe and predict natural phenomena.
